## Setting up your development environment

### Pulumi prerequisites

Please refer to the [main Pulumi repo](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/)'s [CONTRIBUTING.md file](
https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developing) for details on how to get set up with Pulumi.

## Committing Generated Code

You must generate and check in the SDKs on each pull request containing a code change, e.g. adding a new resource to `resources.go`.

1. Run `make build_sdks` from the root of this repository
1. Open a pull request containing all changes
1. *Note:* If a large number of seemingly-unrelated diffs are produced by `make build_sdks` (for example, lots of changes to comments unrelated to the change you are making), ensure that the latest dependencies for the provider are installed by running `go mod tidy` in the `provider/` directory of this repository.

## Running Integration Tests

The examples and integration tests in this repository will create and destroy real
cloud resources while running. Before running these tests, make sure that you have
configured access to your cloud provider with Pulumi.

_TODO: Add any steps you need to take to run integration tests here_
